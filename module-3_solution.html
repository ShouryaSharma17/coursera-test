			<p>Classical Game theory helps us to understand the situation in which some decision makers connect with each other. It helps us to analyse a competitive situation. It contains of the essence of the particular situation. Classical game theory is a well-developed branch of mathematics and has wide applications starting from economics, biology, sociology and so on [1]. It talks about set of strategy called Nash Equilibrium in which the players get maximum payoff and unilateral deviation of any player will reduce the payoff [1]. It is factorizable and it includes classical bits i.e. either 0 or 1 and no intermediate states.
Quantum Game Theory is an extension of classical game theory as it includes the superposition of strategies to be used on initial states. It is a probabilistic approach which doesn’t refer to the formalism of quantum mechanics using state vectors, unitary transformation and quantum measurements [1]. It involves qubits i.e. not only 0 and 1 but also the intermediate states. The quantum game reduces itself to the classical game when the considered probability set becomes factorable [1].

A Bayesian game is a game of incomplete information in which the rules of the game are not fully known to all players. In this one player is unaware of the other player’s strategies and payoffs, they are known as games of incomplete information.
